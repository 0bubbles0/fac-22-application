      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <h2>My name is <span class="p-bold p-bold-key">Barbara</span> (she/her)</h2>
      <p>Some of my favourite <span class="p-bold">activities</span> are playing the violin, pub-quizzes and knitting
        (also: making lists)</p>
      <p>Currently, I am working on becoming a <span class="p-bold p-bold-key">Web Developer</span></p>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>During the studies for my <span class="p-bold p-bold-key">BSc Economics at SOAS, University of London </span>
        (School
        of Oriental and African Studies), I <span class="p-bold">learned</span> to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="p-bold">Research</span> new topics in collaboration as well as independently.</li>
        <li><span class="p-bold">Solve</span> real-life <span class="p-bold">problems analytically</span> through
          abstract models.</li>
        <li>Understand the causes and societal <span class="p-bold">cost of unequal opportunities</span> and unused
          potential, as well as
          international development issues, incentives and interactions between individuals, businesses and societies.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy the <span class="p-bold">international environment</span> and <span class="p-bold">diversity of
            ideas</span> from teachers and
          peers, around 50% of us being
          international, from all walks of life, cultures, ages, classes and personal identities.</li>
        <li>Value the <span class="p-bold">creativity</span> and brain power that can be sparked through <span
            class="p-bold">respectful,
            open-minded dialogue</span>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><span class="p-bold p-bold-key">Discovering Coding</span> through a random advert for the Google Grasshopper
        app <span class="p-bold">felt</span>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Immediately <span class="p-bold">comfortable</span> and logical.</li>
        <li>Like <span class="p-bold">lightning struck</span> – why had no one shown me this at school?</li>
        <li><span class="p-bold">Inviting</span> – I had always assumed it a secret club for teenage boys.</li>
        <li><span class="p-bold">Exciting</span> to imagine the life-hacks I might learn to create with a few lines of
          code!</li>
        <li>Like a path to get my life <span class="p-bold">unstuck</span> from a few lost years.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>My Personal Values</h3>
      <p>Through improving my <span class="p-bold">coding skills</span>, I hope to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contribute in preparing us for a <span class="p-bold">better future</span>.</li>
        <li>Play an active part in fully <span class="p-bold">digitising society</span>, opening it up to less
          tech-savvy consumers.</li>
        <li><span class="p-bold">Support</span> people and institutions already on that path, lend my brain-power to
          <span class="p-bold">“good tech”</span>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>I wish to contribute to technology that <span class="p-bold">enables people to thrive</span> and is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="p-bold">Accessible & Inclusive:</span> affordable/free, proactively non-biased, open to all
          physical and learning
          abilities.</li>
        <li><span class="p-bold">Sustainable:</span> anticipating impacts on the environment, society, mental and
          physical health.</li>
        <li><span class="p-bold">Responsible:</span> consensual, considerate of data and consumer protection, protecting
          vulnerable groups,
          preventing misinformation.</li>
        <li><span class="p-bold">Supportive:</span> strengthening community spirit and personal wellness (financial,
          physical, emotional).</li>
        <li>Bridging <span class="p-bold">opportunity gaps</span>.</li>
        <li>Solving <span class="p-bold">everyday problems</span> for ordinary people.</li>
        <li>Easing <span class="p-bold">decision fatigue</span> and the burden of <span class="p-bold">emotional
            labour</span>, especially for women
          and underfunded
          communities.

    <section id="c-fac-appl" class="page-content">
      <h3>Founders and Coders</h3>
      <h4>A place in the Founders and Coders Cohort 22 in Autumn 2021 would be an incredible opportunity to continue
        pursuing these
        goals in tandem with others.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Participating in the Coaching Programme and especially working with the Dragonfly Study Group has already
          felt like a Bootcamp. The last few weeks supercharged my progress and motivation, gave me more support and
          confidence on the path to being a developer than I could have imagined. </li>
        <li>In the group, we have already had several fantastic “aha!” moments and it would be an absolute privilege
          to continue learning together, to keep up the pace, have some progress accountability and explore
          collaborating on GitHub. While creating this website, I already considered several times how tasks might have
          been shared with partners. It would be exciting and immensely valuable to be able to mix my analytical
          problem-solving aptitude with the fantastic visual design creativity of my fellow current coachees.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>To continue as part of the community</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>It felt safe to be invited to an environment that values mutual supportiveness over competitiveness. The
          special emphasis on pastoral care and respectful and encouraging communication has made a lasting impact on
          how I wish to conduct teamwork, which values and inter-personal dynamics I will be more proactive in fostering
          in work environments going forward. Meeting someone with different life experiences is an opportunity to
          learn, not a complication. How can we expect board-rooms to create original solutions if they all have almost
          identical life experiences?</li>
        <li>Already, I have greatly benefited from countless alumni and feel inspired to continue carrying the
          torch. On top of being eager to pass on everything I have learned so far to anyone who will listen, I would be
          especially excited to be involved in workshops for complete beginners – writing first HTML in a text editor or
          starting the first Codepen. Because I am convinced that coding could be a path for others to get themselves
          out of much stickier life situations than mine.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>The Structure of the Course and Apprenticeship would provide the invaluable</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>guidance on technical employer interviews during the Pre-apprenticeship that could help overcome my CV
          and confidence issues.</li>
        <li>financial security and peace of mind for me to fully absorb into the Bootcamp.

        </li>
        <li>full package of Bootcamp, certification and 1-2 years of experience to set me on the career path I
          would enjoy.</li>
      </ul>
